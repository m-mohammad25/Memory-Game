# Memory-Game
In this project, I have created a memory game using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript** and **Sass**.<br>
There are 6 cards, each card has another **identical** card which makes the total number of the cards is 12 cards.<br>
the player keeps **flipping** and **memorizing** the cards positions and try to match each 2 paires together. the game **ends** when the player matches all identical paires.
